# Notes
Collection of notes to save digitally on the repo.

## Boards
#### Input Interface
- Rev2
  - Have specific power distribution broken out to cables to be sent to corresponding boards
  - Each power line has a fuse for protection that is nested locally on the power distribution of each board
  - Replace Arduino Mega programmer with ports for plugging in logic cards that get power from input interface and only store programs via FRAM chip (ports for three cards, selected by switches)

#### Timing Element
- Timing Signals are broken out to cables and organized by board

## Board-to-Board Interfaces
- Input signals and voltage lines are broken out to cables and organized by board

## Programming
- Inevitably replace Arduino Mega programmer with logic cards that store programs on them (or perhaps a logic card variant with an Arduino rather than FRAM IC)
