#### Input Interface
###### Rev2
- Have specific power distribution broken out to cables to be sent to corresponding boards
- Each power line has a fuse for protection that is nested locally on the power distribution of each board
- Replace Arduino Mega programmer with ports for plugging in logic cards that get power from input interface and only store programs via FRAM chip

#### Timing Element
- Timing Signals are broken out to cables and organized by board

## Board-to-Board Interfaces
- Input signals and voltage lines are broken out to cables and organized by board
